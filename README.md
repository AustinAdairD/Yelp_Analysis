# Yelp_Analysis
A Machine Learning Solution to Bridge the Gap for Businesses on Yelp!

* The Yelp Appendix! contains an overview of the ETL, data exploration and model generation of the analysis. It is important to note that the Yelp reviews json file was too large to open on my local computer so it has been redacted  from the posted analysis. This means that text cleaning and sentiment analysis was not performed. Please email adairad@miamioh.edu for the full jupyter notebook if interested. 

* The Yelpo Final Report provides a comprehensive summary of the analysis performed and outlines how businesses can utilize this information. 

* Yelp Datasets will need to be downloaded at https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download (ensure that file names match) before the jupyter notebook can be run.
